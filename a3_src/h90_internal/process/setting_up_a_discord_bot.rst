Creating a discord bot account

Before writing code for the bot, you need to
create a bot account from the Discord developer
portal.

#. Give a name to the application and click on
   "Create".
#. Click on the "Bot" tab and then click
   "Add Bot". Confirm the popup.

   keep it somewhere safe. If you lose it
   you can generate a new one by clicking
   on ``Reset Token``

In the "Bot" tab, make sure the following are
selected by clicking the grey button on the right

Now save the changes made to the Bot tab.


Inviting the bot to a server
============================

To interact with your bot, it needs to be added
to a server.

#. Open the 'OAuth2' tab, then click on the
   'URL Generator'

   following permissions::

#. Copy the generated URL and open it in your
   web browser to add your bot to a server.


Running your bot
================

To run your version of the harmonica bot, make the
following changes to the df files:

* Open the 'default.env' file in located in::

    ~/dev/df/a3_src/h10_resource/key

* Paste your token to the following line and
  save the file::

    TOKEN_DISCORD_<YOUR_BOT_NAME>='<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>

* Go to the discord server where your bot has
  been added and check that it has been added.
* Once it has been added, make sure that the
  bot has the correct channels id's in::

    ~/df/a3_src/h60_system/harmonica/harmonica.stableflow.cfg.yaml

  This can be found under the
  ``# Discord bot integration.`` section where
  channel id's are listen next to the channel
  names. You can check channel names by right
  clicking on a channel in the discord and
  clicking ``Copy link`` The channel id it the
  last string of numbers that come after the
  last '/'.
* To start the bot change directory to::
    ~/dev/df
  and run::
    ./da demo start dm006 start
* If the bot works you should see log messages
  in the terminal after sending messages in the
  server.
